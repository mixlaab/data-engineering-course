# ELT Basics

## Introduction

ELT stands for Extract, Load, Transform, which is a data processing methodology used to integrate data from multiple sources into a target system. Unlike ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), which transforms data before loading it into the target system, ELT loads the data first and then performs transformations within the target system. ELT is commonly used when dealing with large datasets, complex transformations, and data warehousing.

## Concepts

As data engineering evolves, so do the tools and techniques that data engineers use to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data. One of the latest and most innovative techniques is the use of extract, load, transform (ELT) pipelines.

While the basic principles of ELT are straightforward, there are many advanced concepts that data engineers need to be aware of in order to use ELT effectively. In this article, we'll explore some of these advanced concepts and explain how they can be applied to ELT pipelines.

### Distributed Systems and Parallel Processing

As data volumes increase, processing data in a timely manner can become a challenge. To overcome this challenge, many data engineers are turning to distributed systems and parallel processing. In an ELT pipeline, data can be partitioned and processed in parallel across multiple machines, enabling much faster processing speeds.

The use of distributed systems and parallel processing can also improve fault tolerance, as the failure of one machine does not necessarily result in the failure of the entire ELT pipeline. This approach is especially effective when working with large volumes of data, such as those found in big data applications.

### Data Cataloging and Metadata Management

As data becomes more complex and distributed, it can become difficult to track the origin and quality of each dataset. To address this challenge, many data engineers are turning to data cataloging and metadata management tools.

Data cataloging tools allow data engineers to discover, understand, and govern their data assets. They enable data lineage tracking, data quality monitoring, and data discovery. This metadata can then be used to manage data access, usage, and compliance, ensuring that data is being used appropriately and in accordance with company policies.

### Cloud-Based Infrastructure and Services

With the rise of cloud computing, many data engineers are turning to cloud-based infrastructure and services to support their ELT pipelines. Cloud-based infrastructure provides the elasticity and scalability required to handle large volumes of data and the ability to spin up additional resources on demand. This approach can save organizations significant amounts of money, as they only pay for the resources they use.

Cloud-based services, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Glue and Microsoft Azure Data Factory, can provide additional functionality, such as data integration, transformation, and analytics. These services often include pre-built connectors for common data sources, making it easier to extract data from a wide range of systems.

### Data Quality Checks and Monitoring

As data moves through an ELT pipeline, it can be subject to errors, duplication, or missing data. To ensure the accuracy and completeness of data, many data engineers are turning to data quality checks and monitoring.

Data quality checks can be automated and run at various stages in the ELT pipeline to ensure that data meets specific criteria, such as completeness, consistency, and accuracy. Monitoring can be used to track data quality over time and identify trends and issues.

### **Machine Learning and AI**

Finally, machine learning and AI can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ELT pipelines. Machine learning algorithms can be used to identify patterns in data and automate data transformation, reducing the need for manual intervention. AI can also be used to predict data quality issues and recommend remediation steps.

In conclusion, ELT pipelines provide a flexible and scalable way to extract, load, and transform data. By applying advanced concepts such as distributed systems and parallel processing, data cataloging and metadata management, cloud-based infrastructure and services, data quality checks and monitoring, and machine learning and AI, data engineers can create robust and efficient ELT pipelines that support their organization's data needs.

## Tools or Environments for ELT Pipelines

Here are five widely used tools or environments for ELT pipelines in the data engineering industry:

**Apache Airflow**: an open-source platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows

**Talend**: a data integration and management tool that supports ELT workflows

**AWS Glue**: a fully managed ETL service that supports both ETL and ELT workflows in the cloud

**Microsoft Azure Data Factory**: a cloud-based data integration service that supports both ETL and ELT workflows

**Google Cloud Dataflow**: a cloud-based data processing service that supports both batch and stream processing, including ELT workflows.
