# SQL Reporting

You will learn about sql querying for data reporting.

# Practice

Use the generator script to produce the data for your practice.

In this practice we will focus on producing queries and storing them into views.
### Considerations

- Create the needed tables and normalize as you consider.
- Every query should be stored in a view.
- Don't mix Companies in your results.
- Every query should be stored in a `create_views.sql` in your own branch.

### Exercises

- select the price and product for every state and month.
- select the amount of sales by product-year for every state.
- select the month with the highest sales for every product.
- select the month with the lowest sales for every product.
- get the most sold category for every company.
- get the total sales (in money) for a company in every state.
